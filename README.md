# Rocket-Elevators-Ruby-Controller

# Usage
I didn't try to execute my code, so I don't know how to test if my code works.

# Description
Example:

This program controls a Column of elevators.

It sends an elevator when a user presses a button on a floor and it takes
a user to its desired floor when a button is pressed from the inside of elevator.

Elevator selection is based on scores given by their activity when the request is done. 1 is the best score you have, it means the elevator is at your floor, it is stopped and it goes in the same direction as you requested. At the opposite, the worst score is 4, when most of elevators are unavailable and you peek the closest to you.
